Grades:  check(-) :  some major problems with the codes and/or analysis
         check    :  good (with some minor gaps in your results/analysis) 
         check(+) :  excellent 
         check(++) : excellent with one of the BONUS problems completed

Problem 2 looks good. 

Problem 3 has some major problems. Looking at your code,
it looks like you're just printing out Harmonic Oscillator wavefunctions (i.e.,
you're not reconstructing the coulomb or square well ground state w.f. as the 
problem asks.) So there seems to be a conceptual misunderstanding of what you're
supposed to be calculating and plotting (Hint: you're supposed to use 
the eigen_basis code to construct eq. 5.22 in the Ch. 5 notes)
